			  <h3>No-Code Robot Polishing Platform</h3>
			  <p>
				<strong>Description:</strong>Additive manufactured surface often needs to be polished to achieve the desired surface texture <br>
				developing a robotic polishing requires a robotic engineer to program the robot, and it is not suitable for high-mix low volume environment <br>
				this an automated toolpath generation framework specifically designed for AM surface polishing. Our solution eliminates the need <br>
				for manual programming and reduces the time required for toolpath fine-tuning, making the process more efficient and cost-effective. <br>
				<strong>Outcome: </strong> This project translated into a $1 Million joint-lab for implementation into a local SME

					<h3>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Sustainability Initiative:</strong> Low-Wind Area Energy Capture Using Vertical Axis Wind Turbine<br>
						<strong>Description:</strong> In regions where wind energy resources are limited, Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) offer an alternative solution for harnessing renewable energy. Unlike traditional Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs), VAWTs have a vertical rotor shaft that spins around a vertical axis. This design allows VAWTs to capture wind energy from any direction, making them suitable for areas with inconsistent or low wind speeds. By utilizing the traffic energy in such regions, VAWTs can efficiently generate electricity and contribute to reducing reliance on fossil fuels. With their compact size and ability to operate in urban and suburban environments, VAWTs have the potential to revolutionize wind power generation and expand the accessibility of clean energy.<br>
						<strong>Outcome:</strong> Received first grant funding of $100K to develop a VAWT that is deployable on highways.

					<h3>Inducing a Realistic Surface Roughness Onto 3D Mesh Data Using a Variation of Generative-Adversarial Network </h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Synthetic Data Generator:</strong> Synthetic Surface Roughness with the help of cGAN<br>
						<strong>Description:</strong> 
						This work introduces a novel technique for simulating realistic surface textures in engineering using machine learning. By training a conditional <br>
						Generative-Adversarial Network (cGAN) on real height maps from additively manufactured components, random 2D height maps representing <br>
						surface textures are generated. The synthetic data is then analyzed for structural similarities to real data using standard surface texture descriptors.<br>
						This approach enhances the accuracy and realism of engineering simulations, improving the reliability of data-driven approaches in surface engineering<br>
